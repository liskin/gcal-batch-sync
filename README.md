Note that this project was born out of a desire to solve a problem I was
facing. While I'm excited to share it with the world, keep in mind that I'll
be prioritizing features and bug fixes that align with my personal use cases.
There may be times when I'm busy with other commitments and replies to

in bursts. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
